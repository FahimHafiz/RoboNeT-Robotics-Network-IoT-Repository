## **🧩 Fusion 360 – Design & Slicing**

---

### **Welcome to the Design & Slicing section of this repository! 🛠️**

This part of the course focuses on the very basic design journey. Here you"ll go through the Fusion 360 and Slicing Parameters.
Here, you’ll learn how is the software interface, basic 2D Design, Construction Plane, Basic 3D operations, Basic assembly and joints. In the Slicing Part you"ll Learn what are the parameters, How they perform under different filaments.

## **📌 Section Overview**

The goal of this section is to equip you with practical skills needed to take a CAD model all the way to a ready-to-print STL file and to fabricate.

We cover essential design rules for 3D printing, how to handle model errors, and how to optimize parts for strength, fit, and printability.

This section focuses on:

* ✅ Instalation, Avail 1 year Subscription plan and understand the **User Interface** of the **Fusion 360**
* ✅ Sketching & Dimension knowledge of any project.
* ✅ 3d Modeling - Perform 3D operations on Fusion 360.
* ✅ Assembly and Joints operations – assemble and joint object to animate.
* ✅ Slicing – Charecteristics of slicing parameters of various Filaments.
