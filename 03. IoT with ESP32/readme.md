# 🌐 IoT with ESP32

This folder contains step-by-step projects to learn **ESP32-based IoT development**—starting from basic ESP32 concepts and Wi‑Fi setup, then moving into web control, sensor dashboards, database logging, and cloud platforms like Firebase.  
All modules are organized as small, focused lessons so you can learn one concept at a time and reuse the same patterns in real projects.

> Tip: If your folder names contain spaces, wrap the link path in angle brackets like this: `[Title](<./Folder Name/>)` to prevent broken links in Markdown. [web:25]

## ✅ What you’ll learn
- ESP32 fundamentals and common development workflow.
- Connecting ESP32 to Wi‑Fi and building web-based controls.
- Sending/receiving data using HTTP (client/server).
- Displaying sensor readings on a web page.
- Logging data to external services (MySQL, Google Sheets).
- Real-time cloud communication using Firebase Realtime Database. [web:62]
