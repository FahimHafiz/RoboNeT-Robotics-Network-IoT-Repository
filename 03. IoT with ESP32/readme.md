# 🌐 IoT with ESP32

This folder offers a structured learning path for ESP32-based IoT projects.  
Starting with ESP32 basics and Wi-Fi setup, it progresses through web servers, sensor integration, and cloud connectivity.  
Modules cover LED control, data logging to databases like MySQL and Firebase, and real-time monitoring.


## ✅ What you’ll learn

- ESP32 fundamentals and common development workflow.
- Connecting ESP32 to Wi‑Fi and building web-based controls.
- Sending/receiving data using HTTP (client/server).
- Displaying sensor readings on a web page.
- Logging data to external services (MySQL, Google Sheets).
- Real-time cloud communication using Firebase Realtime Database.
