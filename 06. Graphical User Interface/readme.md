# 🖥️ GUI (PyQt6 + IoT)

This folder offers a structured learning path for building PyQt6 GUI applications for IoT.  
Starting with PyQt6 basics and installation, it progresses through widgets, signals, and designer tools.  
Modules cover event-driven programming and IoT-specific projects like sensor dashboards and monitoring systems.

## ✅ What you’ll learn

- Install and structure PyQt6 projects, then build windows using widgets + layouts.
- Handle events properly using the Qt **signals & slots** mechanism.
- Design UI visually using **Qt Designer**, then integrate it into Python apps.

## 📂 Folder Contents

This section lists the 12 modules in the GUI tutorial series.  
Each module provides hands-on projects and code examples for specific PyQt6 concepts.  
Topics range from PyQt6 introduction to advanced IoT monitoring systems.
