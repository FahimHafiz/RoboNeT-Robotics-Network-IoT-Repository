#  Hardware Prerequisites

 Before you can start, you'll need to gather a few key components. This chapter is split into the *essentials* to get the Pi running, and the *recommended* parts for our IoT projects.

## **1.1 Essential Components**

#### These are the non-negotiable items you need to follow this guide.

1.  **Raspberry Pi 4 Model B:** The computer itself. (A 4GB or 8GB model is highly recommended for Ubuntu).

2. **microSD Card:** This is the Pi's "hard drive." Get a good quality, "Class 10" or "A1" rated card with at least **32GB** of storage.

3.  **USB-C Power Supply:** The Pi 4 needs a high-quality power supply. A standard phone charger will *not* work. You need one that provides at least **5V / 3A**.

4. **Micro HDMI to HDMI Cable:** To connect your Pi to a monitor. Note the "Micro" end—a standard HDMI cable won't fit.

5. **Monitor or TV:** Any modern display with an HDMI port will work.

6.  **USB Keyboard & Mouse:** Standard wired or wireless peripherals to control your Pi.

## **1.2 Recommended Components for IoT Projects**
 To follow along with **Chapters 4** and **6** you will need these common electronics parts. 

*  **Breadboard:** A plastic board that lets you build and test circuits without soldering.

*  **Jumper Wires:** For connecting components on the breadboard to the Pi's GPIO pins.

*  **LEDs:** (Light Emitting Diodes) To create a simple light-up circuit.

* **Push Buttons:** To create a simple input circuit.

*  **Resistors (330Ω):** **Crucial\!** These limit the current flowing to components like LEDs and prevent them from burning out.

*  **Ultrasonic Sensor:** A common sensor used to measure distance.

## **1.3 Assembling Your Kit**

 Let's connect everything for the first time. It's best to do this *before* you plug in the power.

1.  **Insert the microSD Card:** If you have already flashed the OS (from Chapter 3), insert the microSD card into the spring-loaded slot on the *bottom* of the Raspberry Pi.

2.  **Connect Keyboard & Mouse:** Plug your USB keyboard and mouse into any of the four USB ports.

3.  **Connect Monitor:** Plug the Micro HDMI cable into the Pi's port labeled **HDMI0** (the one closest to the power port). Connect the other end to your monitor.

4.  **Connect Power (Last\!):** This is the final step. Plug your USB-C power supply into the Pi.

#### The Pi does not have a power button. As soon as you plug it in, it will boot up. You should see a red power light come on, and after a few seconds, text and then the Ubuntu setup screen (from Chapter 3\) should appear on your monitor.
