# 🧪 Simulation (Tinkercad)

This folder offers a structured learning path for Arduino simulations in Tinkercad.  
Starting with Tinkercad basics and Arduino fundamentals, it progresses through sensors, motors, and displays.  
Modules cover virtual circuit building, coding, and testing without physical hardware.

## ✅ What you’ll learn

- Build Arduino circuits virtually (wiring + components).
- Write and test code instantly using Tinkercad’s simulation environment.
- Practice common modules used in real IoT/embedded projects (sensors, displays, motors).

## 📂 Folder Contents
