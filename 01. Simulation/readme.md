# 🧪 Simulation (Tinkercad)

This folder contains hands-on **Arduino simulations** designed and tested in **Autodesk Tinkercad Circuits**, so you can learn hardware interfacing even without physical components. Tinkercad Circuits allows you to build circuits, write Arduino code, and run them using the **Start Simulation** button in the browser.

## ✅ What you’ll learn
- Build Arduino circuits virtually (wiring + components).   
- Write and test code instantly using Tinkercad’s simulation environment.  
- Practice common modules used in real IoT/embedded projects (sensors, displays, motors).
