# 🚗 RoboQuest: Smart Navigation Robot Car

Welcome to the **RoboQuest** project chapter! In this module, we’ll build and program a **GPS and Bluetooth-enabled smart robot car** using ESP32. This car will be capable of manual remote control, path recording, obstacle detection, and autonomous navigation via coordinates sent from a smartphone.

## 📚 What Will You Learn?

Through this project, you will:

- Understand how to interface ESP32 with GPS and Bluetooth modules.
- Learn to control a robot car via mobile phone apps.
- Capture and visualize GPS paths using tools like Google My Maps.
- Integrate ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection.
- Enable autonomous navigation to user-defined coordinates.

## 🛠️ Project Outline

### 🔧 **Main Project: RoboQuest - The Smart Navigator**

**RoboQuest** is a smart robot car powered by the ESP32 microcontroller. It allows users to remotely control the car via Bluetooth, record its travel path, detect obstacles using sensors, and even navigate autonomously based on GPS coordinates sent through a mobile app.

## 📋 Tasks Breakdown

Each task adds new functionality and builds on the previous one:

### ✅ **Task 1: Bluetooth-Based Manual Control** — *15 Marks*
- Use a mobile Bluetooth app (like Bluetooth Terminal or a custom controller) to send commands.
- Control car movement (forward, backward, left, right, stop).

---

### ✅ **Task 2: GPS Path Recording & Mapping** — *15 Marks*
- Record the path coordinates as the car moves.
- Send the recorded path to the phone via Bluetooth.
- Import the coordinates into Google My Maps to visualize the route.

---

### ⚙️ **Task 3: Obstacle Detection & Feedback System** — *30 Marks*
- Interface an ultrasonic sensor to detect nearby obstacles.
- Provide real-time alerts (e.g., via Bluetooth or on-car LED/buzzer) when an obstacle is detected.
- Optionally, halt the car to prevent collision.

---

### 🧠 **Task 4: Autonomous Navigation to Sent Coordinates** — *40 Marks*
- User sends GPS coordinates through a mobile app.
- The car uses GPS data to navigate toward the target destination.
- Incorporate logic to move in the right direction and adjust course as needed.
